Terra provides home automation for Telldus products. It is an XBMC addon which supports both USB sticks and Net devices.

The addon should be platform independent - though there are some issues executing os calls with tdtool on Mac.

To install it, download the latest zip file and install it using XBMCs addon installer from zip file. The addon shows up under programs and can be configured and executed like any other program addon.
