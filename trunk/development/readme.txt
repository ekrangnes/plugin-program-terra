You'll find various python scripts here to generate custom portions of settings.xml which can be pretty ugly.

The 32 device limitation is really set by settings.xml. I have room for 64-devices in strings.xml, the language settings, but whenever there are more than 32 devices in settings.xml, the category tab just goes blank. If it is a XBMC bug or something else, beats me. Haven't spent too much time on this, so it might be a trivial fix.
